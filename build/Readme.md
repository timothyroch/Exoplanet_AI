## Files

| File | Type | Description | Used In |
|------|------|--------------|---------|
| **X.parquet** | Parquet | Feature matrix (input data). Contains raw and engineered features such as `log_period`, `dur_over_per`, and `depth_sqrt_dur`. | Training & validation |
| **y.csv** | CSV | Target labels for each sample. Labels are one of: `Confirmed`, `Candidate`, or `False`. | Training & evaluation |
| **feature_list.joblib** | Joblib | Python list of column names in `X`, used to ensure a consistent schema when reloading data. | Training & inference |
| **groups.csv** *(optional)* | CSV | `kepid` identifiers for group-aware train/test splitting to prevent data leakage across the same star. | Grouped CV or data partitioning |
